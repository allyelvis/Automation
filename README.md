Let's go through the code step by step:

We import the requests library, which allows us to send HTTP requests.
We define the OdooOrderAutomation class with two attributes: odoo_url and external_endpoint. These attributes store the URLs of the Odoo instance and the external endpoint, respectively.
In the get_bill_orders_from_odoo method, we make a GET request to the Odoo URL using requests.get. If the response status code is 200 (indicating a successful request), we return the JSON response. Otherwise, we raise an exception with the corresponding status code.
In the send_bill_orders_to_external_endpoint method, we make a POST request to the external endpoint using requests.post. We pass the bill_orders dictionary as JSON data in the request body. If the response status code is 200, we return a success message. Otherwise, we raise an exception with the corresponding status code.
We create an instance of the OdooOrderAutomation class, providing the Odoo URL and the external endpoint URL.
We call the get_bill_orders_from_odoo method to fetch the bill orders from Odoo and store them in the bill_orders variable.
We print the fetched bill orders.
We call the send_bill_orders_to_external_endpoint method to send the bill orders to the external endpoint and store the response message in the response_message variable.
We print the response message.
Conclusion
In this article, we have learned how to automate the process of getting bill orders from Odoo and sending them to an external endpoint using Python. By using the requests library, we can easily make HTTP requests to fetch data from Odoo and send it to another system or service. This automation can save time and effort by eliminating manual data transfer and ensuring data consistency between systems. Feel free to customize the OdooOrderAutomation class to fit your specific requirements and integrate Odoo with other systems seamlessly.
