In this article, we will learn how to automate the process of getting bill orders from Odoo, an open-source ERP system, and sending them to an external endpoint using Python. This can be useful when you want to integrate Odoo with another system or service.

Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

Python installed on your machine
The requests library installed (pip install requests)
Setting up the OdooOrderAutomation class
To automate the process, we will create a Python class called OdooOrderAutomation. This class will handle fetching bill orders from Odoo and sending them to the external endpoint.
